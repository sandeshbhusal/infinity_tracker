Trinity Computer Council.

The club that designs and publishes the "Infinity" magazine every year. This has been the identity of this club through all these years. However, Trinity Computer Council is something much much bigger than what is seen on the outside. This club encompasses all the aspects of Computers, literally. The members include skilled hackers to creative designers to the people who have what it takes to learn. Simply knowledge is not everything, as we quote in the club. To be good at computers, you need to have that passionate impulse to learn, to chow down everything, to hack down everything to the bits and re-make again. Our club includes everyone, right from skilled people who have accomplished amazing feats, to absolute beginners who crave for knowledge on how stuff works. We constantly improve our knowledge. Also, we are entrusted with the task of creating INFINITY every year, a task that requires dilligence, design and precise knowledge. We pull off amazing feats together, and though we do not show what we do, we know what we are doing.

Infinity is an annual school magazine published by Trinity International College. All the works in the magazine have been done by Trinity Computer Council in collaboration with other clubs, such as Trinity Student club and Trintity Art and Literature club. We breathe life into the very backbone of the pages those of which bind the alumni and students with the school. This is a legendary work that has been handed down from the very beginning. In fact, the club is a pioneer in publishing this magazine.
