Hello, there. You browsing this blog probably means that you are going through a difficult stage in a relationship. S/He is treating you differently, and the new relationship is not going on quite well. Things seems to be stuck, they are not moving anywhere... Well, my friend. Life Sucks. But even more, relationships do. "Wrong!" you might think. But I mean those relationships that do not have a little something called spontaneity and reciprocity. And what more, you seem to be stuck in the grey zone in your relationship. "I know friendzone, but what on earth is 'grey zone'?" Well, we shall soon find out.

Relationships mostly start out of casual teasings your friends give. These funny feelings, the larvae grow over and soon become the butterflies in your stomach. You ask them out, and they agree. You both confess your feelings to each other and are ready to be in a relationship.
